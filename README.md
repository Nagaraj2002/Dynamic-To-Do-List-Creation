## 🌟 Dynamic To-Do List Application

This is a dynamic to-do list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to manage their tasks in three sections: Pending, In Progress, and Completed. Users can add tasks, move them between sections, and optionally use drag-and-drop functionality.

## 🌟 Features

 Add New Task: Users can add tasks to the Pending section with a title and optional description.
 
Move Tasks Between Sections: Tasks can be moved between Pending, In Progress, and Completed sections with buttons or drag-and-drop.

Drag and Drop (Optional): Users can optionally use drag-and-drop functionality to move tasks between sections.

Persist Tasks: Tasks are stored in local storage, so they persist even after a page refresh.
